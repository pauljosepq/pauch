# Pauch CLI

This is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for creating Git commits using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification. Conventional Commits provides a structured way of writing commit messages that make it easier to understand the purpose and impact of each change.

## 📃 Usage

To use this tool, first download the package as a development dependency from the Node package manager (NPM):

`npm install pauch -D`

After installing simply run the `pauch` command, and it will guide you through the options.


## 👪 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or feature requests, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the Conventional Commits specification for your commit messages.
